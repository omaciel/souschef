SousChef
========

    *sous-chef [soo-shef; Fr. soo-shef]: the second in command in a kitchen; the person ranking next after the head chef.*

On October 2nd, 2006 I walked into my very first "Linux" job at rPath_ in what has proven to be a life changing experience. As someone I know recently said, an awesome roller coaster ride with more twists, turns and air time than I could ever have dreamed of!

Early on, for the most part, it felt like drinking from a fire hose as I struggled to switch to a fast paced startup environment and using an enormous variety of different technologies and tools from those I had grown used to at my previous employers. Through the many ups and downs that we've gone through, one constant has remained with me at all times: my unfaltering, unshakable commitment to the company, to its goals and my love for Conary_, their **next generation software package management system**.

The culmination of this love/passion was the birth of my personal pet project, `Conary Recipes`_, a web site compendium of conary "recipes" for those who, like me, understand and appreciate the beauty and power that a conary-managed system can offer to power users, and want to learn by example how to leverage it to package software for their own use. It is also a place where seasoned packagers can show off their skills and let other people vote for their favorite recipes!

**Conary Recipes** is the fruit of my adventures into the wonderful world of **Django** and is brought to you thanks to the hard work of **Ely√©zer Mendes Rezende**, **Evandro Pastor** and **Pawel Pogorzelski**, who willingly jumped at my invitation to work on my new project and selflessly devoted their free time to help me get it off the ground!

As we're still working out the kinks and workflow for the web site, access is by **invitation only** until we feel that we're ready for public usage. If you're truly interested in taking the site for a spin and helping us improve the overall user experience, drop me a line and I'll get you started. Also, feel free to file bug reports or feature requests using our `issues tracking system`_.
